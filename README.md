This GitHub repository provides an in-depth sentiment analysis of customer reviews for Airbnb listings in Seattle, aiming to offer actionable insights for hosts and policymakers.

## Introduction:
The growth of the sharing economy has disrupted many traditional industries as it
allows people to access the resources at lower cost and provides income to those who
share their resources, and the travel industry is no exception. Airbnb, one of the most
successful examples of the sharing economy, has rapidly expanded its presence
worldwide since its founding in 2008. The platform allows individuals to rent out their
homes, apartments, or rooms to travelers seeking a unique experience and an
alternative to traditional hotel accommodations. As Airbnb continues to grow, it is
important to understand how customers perceive their experience on the platform in
order to improve the user experience and support the sustainable growth of the
company.

## Motivation for Study:
The objective of this study is to analyze customer reviews of Seattle Airbnb
listings using sentiment analysis, with the aim of providing business owners with
a rapid way to grasp the general opinions and feedback of their customers. By
analyzing customer reviews, we can gain insights into what customers like and
dislike about Airbnb listings in Seattle. This information can be used to identify
areas for improvement and to provide actionable feedback to hosts. In addition,
the study can provide insights into the overall sentiment of the Seattle Airbnb
market, which can be useful for businesses and policymakers.

## Relevant Theory:

emotional tone of the text. It involves the use of natural language processing
(NLP) techniques to identify words and phrases that express positive or negative
sentiment. Sentiment analysis has been widely used in marketing and customer
experience management to gain insights into customer feedback and improve
business processes. In the context of Airbnb, sentiment analysis can be used to
identify areas for improvement and to support the sustainable growth of the
